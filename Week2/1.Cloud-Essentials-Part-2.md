# Cloud Essential Part 2

**TASK**: This week, like last week, will continue the [Cloud Essentials Learning Plan](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/82/cloud-foundations-learning-plan?dt=sec&sec=lp) with the next 5 courses.  Though there are more courses, they're each much shorter than last week's.

> In total, these lessons contain about 5 hours of content.

> This will finish all courses ***except*** the Exam Prep course. That's for next week!
