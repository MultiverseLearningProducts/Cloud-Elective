# SES Permissions

Our function works, but it doesn't yet do anything! Let's hook it up to AWS Simple Email Service (SES)!

## Connecting to AWS Simple Email Service (SES)

**In `serverless.yml`**

1. We need to give permissions to our lambda function to send emails. So right under `region`, indented once from `provider`, add the [iam role statement](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/iam):

```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs16.x
  region: us-west-2
  # Below is new
  iam:
    role:
      statements:
        - Effect: "Allow"
          Action:
            - "ses:SendEmail"
            - "ses:SendRawEmail"
          Resource: "*"
```

**In `handler.js`:**

1. In the `handler.js` file, at the top of the file, we need to import AWS and invoke it with our region (`aws-sdk` is pre-installed in lambda function Node environments).

```javascript
// top of file
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const ses = new AWS.SES({ region: 'us-west-2' });
```

2. Then, in the same `handler.js` file, inside the `exports.handler.sendEmail` function, before the return statement, we need to [call `ses.sendEmail`](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-send-email-ses/). Use your own email in the `ToAddresses` and in `Source`.

```javascript
// inside the `exports.handler.sendEmail` function, before the `return` statement
const params = {
  Destination: {
    ToAddresses: ['example@example.com'], // This should be your email address
  },
  Message: {
    Body: {
      Text: {
        Data: 'This is a message generated automatically from a Lambda function.',
      },
    },
    Subject: {
      Data: 'Hello from Lambda',
    },
  },
  Source: 'example@example.com', // This is the email listed in sender. Set it to your email for this practice
};
await ses.sendEmail(params).promise();
// in the object that is `return`ed, replace the `body.message` property with `Email sent to ${params.Destination.ToAddresses}`
```

3. Git add, commit and push, and once your function deploys, visit the url again. Uh oh! There's an error response! 🙈 `Internal Server Error`

**Find the Error**

One of the difficult things when first using Cloud technologies is finding the error logs. The logs for our Lambda function live in CloudWatch.
1. Back in the Console, when you look at your Lambda Function, click "Monitor" → "Logs" → "View Logs in CloudWatch" to view your log stream with the list of all requests.
2. In here, you should see an error `Email address is not verified. The following identities failed the check in region US-WEST-2: example@example.com`
3. We forgot to add your email to the sandbox! 🤦‍♂️ 

**In AWS Console**

Since our lambda function is [not out of the sandbox yet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html), we need to [verify the identities (domains or email addresses) that we send emails from](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ses-554-400-message-rejected-error/).

1. In the AWS console, search for SES and navigate to Amazon Simple Email Services
2. Click on "Create identity"
3. Select "Email address" and type yours in (this needs to be one you have access to, in order to verify it)
4. Click "Create identity"
5. Check your email for an email from Amazon Web Services, and click the link to verify your email
6. This address is now added as a verified identity. Now, visit the URL again, and this error should no longer show up.
7. Check your email now, for an email from… yourself! It should have the subject and body from above.
