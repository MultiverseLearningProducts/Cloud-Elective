# Query Parameters

It's cool that we can return a random number from 1 to 10, but what if we wanted to make it configurable? 

**TASK**: Add some inputs to enable a range! If a user passes some parameters in the URL, the `handler` method's `event` parameter gets passed with `queryStringParameters`. We can use these to extend our random number generator!

## Query Parameters

1. Back in the Code source editor, on the first line of the function, pull out the `event.queryStringParameters` and for now, let's return them as another property on the response:
    ```javascript
    exports.handler = async (event) => {
        const queryParams = event.queryStringParameters || {};

        const body = {
        randomNumber: Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10), // the random number from last step
        queryParams // any query params passed from the client
        };
    
        const response = {
            statusCode: 200,
            body, // the object above
        };
        return response;
    };
    ```

2. Deploy your function and visit the URL again, and you should see a response like this
    ```javascript
    {
        queryParams: { },
        randomNumber: 7
    }
    ```
3. The queryParams are empty, because we haven't added any yet! So now, visit the same url, but add this to the end of the URL `?min=10&max=15`. Now, you should get a response like 
    ```javascript
    {
        queryParams: {
            min: "10",
            max: "15"
        },
        randomNumber: 8
    }
    ```

4. We've identified our query parameters, but the random number isn't within the range, since we haven't used the `min` and `max` yet. Pull out the `min` and `max` properties from event.queryStringParameters and use them in your calculation of the random number. To get the parameters, we'll need to pull them out of the query string parameters passed!
    ```javascript
    const queryParams = event.queryStringParameters || {};
    let {min = 0, max = 10} = queryParams;
    min = Number(min);
    max = Number(max);
    ```
6. Finally, we'll have to adjust our `randomNumber` expression to use the new `max` and `min`.

    Before, we did not want to include 0, so we used Math.ceil().  This time, we want to include our min, so we'll use Math.floor().

    ```javascript
    Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min)
    ```

    Set body.randomNumber to be this expression, and we should be returning the correct random number!

7. If all the above was done correctly, when supplying query params like `?min=10&max=15`, we should see a response like this:
    ```javascript
    {
        queryParams: {
            min: "10",
            max: "15"
        },
        randomNumber: 12
    }
    ```
8. Please paste your Function URL here.


### Solution

<details>

Your final function should look something like this. It's OK if your exact implementation is different, though!

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const queryParams = event.queryStringParameters || {};
    let {min = 0, max = 10} = queryParams;
    min = Number(min);
    max = Number(max);

    const body = {
      randomNumber: Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min),
      queryParams
    };
   
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body,
    };

    return response;
};
