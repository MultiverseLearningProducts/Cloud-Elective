# Cloud Practitioner Essentials

This week’s task is straightforward (though it will take awhile!): Start and complete the first 2 courses of the Cloud Essentials Learning Plan. 
1. First, [enroll in the Learning Plan here](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/82/cloud-foundations-learning-plan?dt=sec&sec=lp).
2. Next, complete the course content for the first 2 courses, and upload your certificates here!

> All in all, there is about 6.5 hours of content in these lessons. Enjoy!

> The "Job Roles" lessons are quite dry, 😴 but hang in there! 🧗‍♂️ The Cloud Practitioner Essentials training is MUCH more enjoyable! 😻
