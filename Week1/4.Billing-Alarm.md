# Billing Alarms ðŸš¨

One of the greatest features of AWS is its elasticity and extensibility. Since there are virtually no limits to what you can do with AWS, there are also virtually no limits to what you can ***spend***. ðŸ˜± This should put much fear in your heart (and pocketbook! ðŸ’´ ).

Of course, we will help you to use only the free services on AWS, but the free tier has limits, and since it's extremely easy to rack up a 6-figure monthly bill in AWS without knowing it, it's ***imperative*** to set up a billing alarm that will email you whenever your bill goes over a set amount.

## Create a Billing Alarm

> What amount should you set it to? That's up to how much you're OK with spending on AWS, but we would suggest $0 as you are just starting to learn how to use AWS (you can always go back and adjust later!). An alert set for $0 will not impact anything you need to do for this module!

The directions below are [taken from this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html).

### Enable Billing Alerts
1. Open the AWS Billing console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/.
