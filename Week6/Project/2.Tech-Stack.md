# Tech Stack Selection
Discuss your tech stack with your team member(s) and answer the following questions. We need to know what you've chosen to learn and work on!

## Serverless Platform
Throughout this elective, we have learned the technologies offered by AWS. **Unless strongly opinionated otherwise, your project should continue to use AWS.**

<span style ="color: #FE4646">**Exception**</span>: If your company has a requirement that you learn [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) or [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/#overview) instead of AWS, then that is the platform that you should use!

1. The cloud provider (tech stack) you will use to build your project

## Primary Technology

We learned the basics of Lambda Functions, so that we could kick-start you into the cloud ecosystem. However, there is far more that can be done with serverless.

**We recommend you choose AWS Lambda** (or serverless functions in general) for the primary technology to learn and use in your application, so that you can deepen your knowledge in one area instead of having surface-level knowledge in multiple areas. However, you're welcome to choose something else, if it interests you enough and you can use it in the premise you select!

1. The primary technology/service you'll use to build your project:

## Secondary (new) Technology

This project is all about learning something new! So add in other technologies that will integrate with your Lambda function.

Choose at least one from this list. Two or more is great, too, if they can be used in the project premise you select. Technologies with an always-free tier:
- From your lambda function, make call(s) to store data in a [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) database.
- Use [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to publish a message, and use a separate lambda function (or more than one!) that subscribes to that topic
- Use [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) to queue up messages via one lambda function, and process them via another function



Other technologies that have a 12-mo free tier or no free tier:
> Careful, you'll likely incur costs using these!
- EC2/ECS/ECR - Deploying Containers (i.e. triggered by a Lambda Function)
- S3 - Saving content (images?) in a storage bucket, from a Lambda Function

1. Secondary Technology (or technologies) you will use in your project:

## DevOps Technology
Choose at least one new DevOps technology to use in your project. A few examples:
- Use [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/blog/container-support-for-lambda) or [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) to run your lambda function(s) **locally** in a docker container
- [Test your Lambda Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) via the local console
- Use the serverless framework or AWS SAM to deploy your function from the command line instead of using a GitHub action
