# Project Ideation
We've learned a lot and built many skills at this point. And we've chosen a new piece of tech we're going to learn in this new project. Now is the time to put on your mad scientist hat and think up something crazy! Which cloud services can you wrangle together to build a cool cloud-based app?

![Think of App Ideas](../assets/4.Ideas.gif)

Think through different ideas and come up with one. Below, we've listed some App ideas to get your brain juices flowing, but the best app ideas are ones that you want to build! So don't be confined to this list!

## Select Your Deployment Project

> If you opt to do this project in groups, you will not have large amounts of workshop time to complete the app as there are additional lessons instead of work time. Keep this in mind as you decide the app you are opting to create!

1. Briefly describe your app idea

> Use this list as a launch pad, but write down lots of app ideas before paring it down to your final decision.

## Example Project Ideas

For all these ideas, you must use cloud functions (like Lambda) and at least 1 new piece of cloud technology. You're welcome to use other tech, as well.

### Blog Service ‚úèÔ∏è
- Build your own back-end-only blog service. Allow users to create an account, post their personal musings, follow other accounts, and react to the content of other users. Note: This would be a big lift, given the skills we've just learned. AWS best practice for API endpoints and Lambda is to use a separate Lambda function for each API route.

### Log-In and Authentication Service ü™™

We've already learned about JWTs and authentication, but that was using one big server (a "monolith"). This time, you could create the beginnings of a "microservice" architecture: A different lambda function for each operation.
- Register - Accepts username/password/user data (name, email, etc) and creates a user record (could use DynamoDB)
- Log In - Accepts username/password and sends back a token if successful
- Get user data - Accepts JWT token and sends back user data if valid and the user exists

### Image Processor üì∏
- An image processor that converts images to different formats or resizes images

### New-User Notification Function üë® 
- A function to add a new item to a database. This function triggers‚Ä¶
- A function that calls SES to send an email to a list of users.

### Daily Inventory Report üìù 
- A function that runs every day at 8am and sends an email to a list of users with a daily inventory report.

### Dad Jokes Service üòÜ 
- An Alexa skill that responds with a random joke, queried from the [dad jokes API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) (or use a random fun fact API). The lambda function is what connects the Alexa skill to the API.

### Cat Image Detector üê±
- A function that accepts an image uploaded to S3 and uses [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?trk=7b8e3dca-c920-4788-af8a-416e565c0118) to detect number of cats in the image

### React App Deployed ‚öõÔ∏è
- Lambda functions can't "serve" React apps directly, but you could build a function that made a call to a server that builds a react app and uploads the built static content to an S3 bucket, which would be the location of the deployed app.

### Bonus: Full-stack App

For whatever premise you decide to choose, you could optionally create a front end that calls the service. The front end could be built via lambda, as mentioned above, or served via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/vercel-for-github) or any other cloud deployment service. Something like‚Ä¶
- Create a front end that calls the API Gateway URL and displays the data. Similar to how you might use a traditional server.
- Front end could call multiple Lambda functions that you have created and use them to interact. For example:
    - Use the authentication service to log in and get a JWT
    - Next, send the JWT to a user-profile service that serves up user data from a Dynamo DB table
    - Subsequent user interactions with the app trigger API calls to other Lambda functions that do things like create new records or read from a Dynamo DB lookup.
