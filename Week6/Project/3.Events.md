# New Events to Experiment With

There are many different events that can trigger a cloud function. For AWS, see the [list of services that can trigger a Lambda event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html). For this project, choose at least one new event to experiment with and use in your app. One of the most common and useful events is an API call, as we have demonstrated. But there are others.

### Examples
- API Call. You've already worked with function URLs, but try your hand at creating an [API Gateway instead](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-apigateway.html). Also, instead of `GET`, you could create it as a `POST`/`DELETE`/`PUT`/`PATCH`.
- [S3 upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html)
- Run a [scheduled task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html) (like a cron job).
- Invoked from another AWS service (like a Lambda function)
- Invoked from a server call, via the [AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html).
- Alexa skill (see the docs on [using an Alexa skill with Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html)).
