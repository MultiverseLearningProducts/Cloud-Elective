# Collaborating as a Team

> If you are working alone, then you can skip these instructions and [invite your coach as a collaborator on your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) and provide the link to your repo below.

If you've chosen to complete this as a group/pair project, you'll need to create a GitHub Organization.

> These steps will be done by one person (ideally as a team, with one person screen-sharing)

## Create a GitHub Organization
In order to create a project with all the features we’ll need, you’ll create an organization.

1. [Create a GitHub Organization here](https://github.com/account/organizations/new?plan=team_free) (or use an org from a past project if you would like). This step is optional, only necessary if you’re doing a group/pair project.
2. Go to the “People” tab and **invite each member of your team** to the organization and **invite your coach**. This should be at a URL like `https://github.com/orgs/<your-org-name>/people`.
    - If you’re solo and haven’t created an Org, just make sure your [coach is added as a collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

## Set Base Permissions to Admin

1. Under Settings → (under Access in the sidebar) → Collaborators and Teams
2. In the “Base Role” box, click Manage.  This should be at a URL like `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org-name>/settings/member_privileges`
3. Set the Base Permissions to Admin.

## Git Repo

You'll need a main repo to track your project.
1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Choose a repo name (careful, this name will stick around for awhile!) 
3. Set your Organization as the “Owner” when making the repo.
