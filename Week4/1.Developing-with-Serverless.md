# Developing with Severless

Now that we have a foundational understanding of the general architecture of the services available through AWS, let's dig in and learn how to develop using AWS tools! This week's focus is one of the more popular and "buzzword" services in the AWS ecosystem: Serverless Development!

The skills we acquire this week will be used in our final project.

### AWS Lambda Foundations

This course gets a bit deeper into how to deploy a Lambda function, and is more documentation/tutorial style. There are no videos, just diagrams and text. This is the meat of the AWS Skill Builder content on how to create Lambda functions.

> This course doesn't walk us through building our first function. We'll do that next week!

### [Amazon API Gateway for Serverless Applications](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/52/amazon-api-gateway-for-serverless-applications)

This course goes over the Amazon API Gateway, which is often used in conjunction with Lambda functions. Like the last course, this one is just text/documents.
